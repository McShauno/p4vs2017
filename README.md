# p4vs2017 - Perforce for Visual Studio 2017 (Unofficial).
P4VS 2017 - Not Official - Modded the p4vs.vsix file.  

TL;DR - Download this file and install: <a href="https://github.com/McShauno/p4vs2017/raw/master/p4vs2017.vsix">p4vs2017.vsix</a>

How?

All I did was unzip the .vsix provided by Perforce (it's a zip file undercover), modified the extension.vsixmanifest to include 
Visual Studio 2017 as an option, zipped everything back up and created the p4vs2017.vsix which you can download from above.
